<h3>Our Values</h3>

<p>
  We believe good quality care encompasses the emotional, physical and social
  well-being of the learning disabled person, which is what we strive for. We
  believe that family and friends play an integral and irreplaceable role in
  supporting the emotional and social well-being of the person with a learning
  disability. We believe is our responsibility to provide a care service that
  delays the need for admission to residential care and thus keep the user in
  the community for as long as they desire. We believe that clients should have
  control over their own lives and make informed decisions that are important to
  them.
